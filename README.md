# Pyramid-Crack

This is a program to find a quad desart pyramid in Minecraft verion 1.17.  

This program makes use of the [seed-finding libarys](https://kaptainwutax.seedfinding.com/) developed by [Kaptainwutax](https://github.com/KaptainWutax) and [Neil](https://github.com/hube12). 




## Docmentation

To run this project, you will need to to have the a copy of [Java JDK 16](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk16-archive-downloads.html) installed and [gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) installed. 
 You will also need a programing environment I recomend [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for this but any environment that could run Java and gradle would work such as VS code. 

Clone the project into program environment:

```bash
clone https://github.com/TatertotGr8/Pyramid-Crack.git
```

It should be fairly straight forward run the project and watch it go. 
Or watch the [showcase](https://youtu.be/YYb_mFQJszU) video found here. And for deeper understanding reffer to the writen documentation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S-tqtsDtqdalQDEEsopy5CnU4O1-bL9xtSGgOIrrxzI/edit#).


Issues relateing to complieing the porject are useally due to incompatiblely between your Gradle and Java installs. Check the gradle documentation for gradle releases Java incompatiblely. Allthough I used Java 16 and Gradle v6.7.1 anything *should* work as long as your Java is above version 11 else the libarys would be incompatible.
