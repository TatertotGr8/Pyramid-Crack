# Pyramid-Crack

This is a program to find a quad desart pyramids in Minecraft verion 1.17.  

This program makes use of the [seed-finding libarys](https://kaptainwutax.seedfinding.com/) developed by [Kaptainwutax](https://github.com/KaptainWutax) and [Neil](https://github.com/hube12). To sreach within adjacent pyrmaid regions local to spawn and returns vaild world seeds that match the conditions of Rpos (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) and (1, 1)




## Docmentation

To run this project, you will need to to have the a copy of [Java JDK 16](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk16-archive-downloads.html) installed and [gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) installed. 
 You will also need a programing environment I recomend [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for this but any environment that could run Java and gradle would work such as VS code. 

Clone the project into program environment:

```bash
clone https://github.com/TatertotGr8/Pyramid-Crack.git
```

It should be fairly straight forward run the project and watch it go. 
Or watch the [showcase](https://youtu.be/YYb_mFQJszU) video found here. And for deeper understanding reffer to the writen documentation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S-tqtsDtqdalQDEEsopy5CnU4O1-bL9xtSGgOIrrxzI/edit#).


Issues relateing to complieing the porject are useally due to incompatiblely between your Gradle and Java installs. Check the gradle documentation for gradle releases Java incompatiblely. Allthough I used Java 16 and Gradle v6.7.1 anything *should* work as long as your Java is above version 11 else the libarys would be incompatible.   

It is also important you have Java proerly installed.  
Make sure you have the folder in a safe spot on your drive and double check you have your bin folder in your path varrible. In Windows environmental varrible set **"JAVA_HOME"** as a varrible to the path of your folder on your drive.

## Lessons Learned
Before this project I have a very foundational exposer to Java. This was the first relevant project I have done in the language though a medium I have an intrest in. Going into this I allready knew an *unhealthy* amount relateing to techinal Minecraft this was an opportunity to apply that knowledge. 

But my personal gain from under takeing this project exceeds the realm of Minecraft.
- Gaining knowledge in [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)  
_what is a build tool and how do I use it?_
- A semi effective troubleshooting plan

Naturally things failed, no artitfacit in this project is on the first draft. That is to be expected in computer science. Allthough isssues ranged I was able to have a checklist of all the things to try when hiting a wall. Starting with double checking my Gradle and Java environmental varribles. To restarting my computer and runing it again for it to sometimes
